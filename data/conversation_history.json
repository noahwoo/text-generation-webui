CodeT5+ addresses the limitations of existing code LLMs in terms of architecture and pretraining objectives, and achieves state-of-the-art results on various code-related tasks.\n\nEvidence:\n- Existing code LLMs have limitations in their architecture, either encoder-only or decoder-only, which limits their performance on different tasks. CodeT5+ allows flexible combination of different modules to suit different downstream applications.\n- Current models employ a limited set of pretraining objectives that may not be relevant to all downstream tasks. CodeT5+ proposes a mixture of pretraining objectives, including span denoising, contrastive learning, text-code matching, and causal language modeling tasks.\n- CodeT5+ leverages off-the-shelf code LLMs to initialize model components, reducing trainable parameters and improving efficiency. Instruction tuning is also explored to align CodeT5+ with natural language instructions.\n- CodeT5+ achieves state-of-the-art results on over 20 code-related benchmarks, including code generation and completion, math programming, and text-to-code retrieval tasks. Instruction-tuned CodeT5+ 16B outperforms other open code LLMs, even surpassing closed-source models.\n\nConclusions:\n- CodeT5+ is a new family of open code LLMs that outperforms similar methods in code generation.\n- CodeT5+ addresses limitations of existing models in terms of architecture and pretraining objectives.\n- CodeT5+ achieves state-of-the-art results on various code-related tasks.\n- CodeT5+ can be dynamically combined to suit different downstream application tasks.\n- CodeT5+ is pretrained on large-scale code unimodal data and uses a mixture of tasks in its pretraining."}]
