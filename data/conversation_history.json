The paradigm under which this revolution takes\nplace is prompt-based learning (or in-context learning). This paradigm has\nfound fruitful application in text-to-image generation where it is being used\nto synthesize digital images from zero-shot text prompts in natural language\nfor the purpose of creating AI art. This activity is referred to as prompt\nengineering - the practice of iteratively crafting prompts to generate and\nimprove images. In this paper, we investigate prompt engineering as a novel\ncreative skill for creating prompt-based art. In three studies with\nparticipants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether\nuntrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write\nprompts, and 3) improve their prompts. Our results indicate that participants\ncould assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability\nincreased with the participants' experience and interest in art. Participants\nfurther were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language. However, even\nthough participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks,\nparticipants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to apply a\ncertain style to the generated images. Our results suggest that prompt\nengineering is a learned skill that requires expertise and practice. Based on\nour findings and experience with running our studies with participants\nrecruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we provide ten recommendations for\nconducting experimental research on text-to-image generation and prompt\nengineering with a paid crowd. Our studies offer a deeper understanding of\nprompt engineering thereby opening up avenues for research on the future of\nprompt engineering. We conclude by speculating on four possible futures of\nprompt engineering.\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-03-13 14:25:56+00:00\n\n#1. **[Prompt Space Optimizing Few-shot Reasoning Success with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03799v1)**\n- **Author(s):**Fobo Shi, Peijun Qing, Dong Yang, Nan Wang, Youbo Lei, Haonan Lu, Xiaodong Lin\n- **Summary**: Prompt engineering is an essential technique for enhancing the abilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) by providing explicit and specific instructions.\nIt enables LLMs to excel in various tasks, such as arithmetic reasoning,\nquestion answering, summarization, relation extraction, machine translation,\nand sentiment analysis. Researchers have been actively exploring different\nprompt engineering strategies, such as Chain of Thought (CoT), Zero-CoT, and\nIn-context learning. However, an unresolved problem arises from the fact that\ncurrent approaches lack a solid theoretical foundation for determining optimal\nprompts. To address this issue in prompt engineering, we propose a new and\neffective approach called Prompt Space. Our methodology utilizes text\nembeddings to obtain basis vectors by matrix decomposition, and then constructs\na space for representing all prompts. Prompt Space significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art prompt paradigms on ten public reasoning benchmarks. Notably,\nwithout the help of the CoT method and the prompt \"Let's think step by step\",\nPrompt Space shows superior performance over the few-shot method. Overall, our\napproach provides a robust and fundamental theoretical framework for selecting\nsimple and effective prompts. This advancement marks a significant step towards\nimproving prompt engineering for a wide variety of applications in LLMs.\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-06-06 15:43:16+00:00\n\n#2. **[Jailbreaking ChatGPT via Prompt Engineering: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13860v1)**\n- **Author(s):**Yi Liu, Gelei Deng, Zhengzi Xu, Yuekang Li, Yaowen Zheng, Ying Zhang, Lida Zhao, Tianwei Zhang, Yang Liu\n- **Summary**: Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have demonstrated vast potential\nbut also introduce challenges related to content constraints and potential\nmisuse. Our study investigates three key research questions: (1) the number of\ndifferent prompt types that can jailbreak LLMs, (2) the effectiveness of\njailbreak prompts in circumventing LLM constraints, and (3) the resilience of\nChatGPT against these jailbreak prompts. Initially, we develop a classification\nmodel to analyze the distribution of existing prompts, identifying ten distinct\npatterns and three categories of jailbreak prompts. Subsequently, we assess the\njailbreak capability of prompts with ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0, utilizing a\ndataset of 3,120 jailbreak questions across eight prohibited scenarios.\nFinally, we evaluate the resistance of ChatGPT against jailbreak prompts,\nfinding that the prompts can consistently evade the restrictions in 40 use-case\nscenarios. The study underscores the importance of prompt structures in\njailbreaking LLMs and discusses the challenges of robust jailbreak prompt\ngeneration and prevention.\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-05-23 09:33:38+00:00\n\n#3. **[A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382v1)**\n- **Author(s):**Jules White, Quchen Fu, Sam Hays, Michael Sandborn, Carlos Olea, Henry Gilbert, Ashraf Elnashar, Jesse Spencer-Smith, Douglas C. Schmidt\n- **Summary**: Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse\neffectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are\ninstructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure\nspecific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a\nform of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an\nLLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented\nin pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing\nwith LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to\nsoftware patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems\nfaced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when\nworking with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research\non prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks.\nFirst, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts\nto solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains.\nSecond, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully\nto improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can\nbe built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit\nfrom combination with other prompt patterns.\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-02-21 12:42:44+00:00\n\n#4. **[A Simple Zero-shot Prompt Weighting Technique to Improve Prompt Ensembling in Text-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06235v1)**\n- **Author(s):**James Urquhart Allingham, Jie Ren, Michael W Dusenberry, Jeremiah Zhe Liu, Xiuye Gu, Yin Cui, Dustin Tran, Balaji Lakshminarayanan\n- **Summary**: Contrastively trained text-image models have the remarkable ability to\nperform zero-shot classification, that is, classifying previously unseen images\ninto categories that the model has never been explicitly trained to identify.\nHowever, these zero-shot classifiers need prompt engineering to achieve high\naccuracy. Prompt engineering typically requires hand-crafting a set of prompts\nfor individual downstream tasks. In this work, we aim to automate this prompt\nengineering and improve zero-shot accuracy through prompt ensembling. In\nparticular, we ask \"Given a large pool of prompts, can we automatically score\nthe prompts and ensemble those that are most suitable for a particular\ndownstream dataset, without needing access to labeled validation data?\". We\ndemonstrate that this is possible. In doing so, we identify several pathologies\nin a naive prompt scoring method where the score can be easily overconfident\ndue to biases in pre-training and test data, and we propose a novel prompt\nscoring method that corrects for the biases. Using our proposed scoring method\nto create a weighted average prompt ensemble, our method outperforms equal\naverage ensemble, as well as hand-crafted prompts, on ImageNet, 4 of its\nvariants, and 11 fine-grained classification benchmarks, all while being fully\nautomatic, optimization-free, and not requiring access to labeled validation\ndata.\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-02-13 10:19:58+00:00\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "summarize the prompting ai art paper please"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**[Prompting AI Art: An Investigation into the Creative Skill of Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13534v1)**\n- **Author(s):**Jonas Oppenlaender, Rhema Linder, Johanna Silvennoinen\n- **Publish Date**: 2023-03-13 14:25:56+00:00\n\nCore Argument:\nThis academic paper investigates the creative skill of prompt engineering in the context of AI art.
